# IBM {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Standard Account Limited Release
{: #betaintro}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} Standard Account Limited Release introduces a new free account, which offers a new way to work in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public Cloud. The Standard account never expires, unlike the 30-day {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} trial. You can continue to work on your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} applications without any concerns about time restrictions. 
{:shortdesc}

Users in the United Kingdom and US South regions are eligible for the Standard account. If you are not in either region, you can still create a Standard account by asking a friend for an invite or reaching out to our sales team at sales@bluemix.net. Once you have a Standard account, you can invite friends and colleagues to participate.    

## Introducing the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Standard account
{: #standardaccount}

You might be wondering what is different in the Standard account as compared to the trial account. The following tables summarize the key details about the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Standard account. 

|What's new in a Standard account? |    
|-----------------|
| The account never expires. |
| Cloud Foundry applications can access up to 256 MB of free, instantaneous runtime memory. |
| You can access free Lite plans for in-demand Watson services like Conversation, Internet of Things Platform, Cloudant NoSQLDB. For more information, see [What’s available](/docs/pricing/standard_account.html#whatsavailable). |
| Your applications will sleep if there is no development activity for 10 days. |
| Your service instances are deleted after 30 days of inactivity. |
{:caption="Table 1. What's new in a Standard account" caption-side="top"}

|What's not changing when a trial account is converted? | 
|-----------------|
|The account is free -- you don't need a credit card. |
|You can continue to use your Lite plan instances. |
|Your organization, spaces, and associated team member access settings stay the same. One organization can be transferred to your new account. |
|The level of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Support stays the same. |
{:caption="Table 2. What's not changing" caption-side="top"}

**Note**: If your trial account doesn't convert, you will see a message that explains why. You might have more than one organization in your existing trial account or apps that cannot be transferred. You can take the appropriate action and then try to convert the account again.

When you are signed up for a Standard account, you can invite team members to collaborate in your organization and spaces, view your usage, create spaces, update your account profile, and manage your organization.

## Lite plans
{: #liteplans}
   
Lite plans, which are also available in a Pay-As-You-Go Account, are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example, a month, or on a one-off usage basis. Here are some examples of Lite plan quotas:

<ul>
<li>Maximum number of registered devices.</li>
<li>Maximum number of application bindings.</li>
<li>Encrypted data storage limit, for example, 1 GB.</li>
<li>Provisioned throughput capacity.</li>
</ul> 

In a Standard account, you can use anything in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Catalog that has a Lite plan. Lite plans are easy to find. By default, when you open the Catalog, all services with a Lite plan are displayed and identified with a Lite tag ![Lite tag](../icons/Lite.svg). Select a service to view the quota details for the associated Lite plan.

## What’s available in the Standard account?
{: #whatsavailable}

In a Standard account, Cloud Foundry applications can access up to a maximum of 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. If you exceed your allocated quota, you can stop some of your apps to free up runtime memory. You can also work with a Kubernetes cluster with 2 CPU and 4 GB RAM. 

During the Standard Account Limited Release, the following {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services offer a Lite plan:

<ul>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.prf_hublong}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.mobilepushfull}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.conversationfull}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.iot_full}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.languagetranslatorfull}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.naturallanguageunderstandingfull}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.personalityinsightsfull}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzerfull}}</li>
</ul>

Some services are not available in all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} regions. For more information, see [Services by region](/docs/services/services_region.html#services_region).

We’ll be adding to this list of services, so stay tuned!

### Quota limits

When quota limits are reached, your application is stopped or your service is disabled. If the Lite plan specifies that the quota is provided on a monthly basis, the resource usage is reset on the 1st of every month when you can resume working with the service. When you are approaching a quota limit, or are at the quota limit, you will receive a notification email. 

You can provision 1 instance per Lite plan. 

**Note**: These limitations apply to a Standard account only. At any time, you can upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or a Subscription account. You pay only for what you use beyond the free allowances. For more information about Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts, see [Signing up for a billable account](/docs/pricing/billable.html#billable).

## Efficiency features
{: #devactivity}

To help you manage your resources, we've included efficiency features that are based on development activity and usage.

### App auto sleep

Your apps will go to sleep after 10 days of development inactivity. This helps when you want to work on a new app, because you won’t find yourself hitting the 256 MB memory quota limit. 

To wake up your apps, start working on them again in the Cloud Foundry command line or the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. 
 
 Here’s a list of all commands that’ll wake up your app:
  * cf push
  * cf restate
  * cf restart
  * cf ssh
  * cf scale
  * cf stop
  * cf start
  * cf create-route
  * cf map-route
  * cf unmap-route
  * cf delete-route
  * cf enable-ssh
  * cf disable-ssh

For usage details, see [Cloud Foundry commands](/docs/cli/reference/cfcommands/index.html).

 **Note**: If your app is already ssh enabled, you can't use the `cf enable-ssh` and `cf disable-sh` commands to wake up your app. 

### Garbage collection

Your Lite plan services are deleted if there isn’t any activity on them for 30 days. This means you don’t have to delete inactive instances when you want to create a new one.
